# List of Hand Segmentation Data Sets
I found that some of these data sets not that easy to find, so I hope this list will help somebody in the future. Feel free to contribute.

## EgoHands
4800 Images, multiple hands in gaming scenarios, such as playing cards, jenga, puzzle. Ego-centric perspective.

## HandSeg Depth Data set *not yet available?*
I can not find the data set, although the paper states that they want to make the data set publicly avaiable. Therefore, this serves as a placeholder. It contains segmentation masks generated from depth images.
